# WELCOME TO USE OUR DATA-STRUTURE PROJECT THAT SIMULATE CPU SCHEDULING 

# What is this project?
##### This project is to help coder to understand how CPU work with different methods.
# How to use this project?
##### Using our program to get random txt file to simulate CPU scheduling or you can prepare extra files to simulate.
----
# How to complie this program?
##### You can download Codeblock or Visual studio code in Windows environment and complie with it.
----
# What things we can do more to simulate CPU scheduling?
##### You can see our readme.md(this file) below to understand what things you can do more.

#### More ways to dertermine CPU effciency (scheduling criteria) 

- [x] Waiting Time
- [ ] CPU Utilization
- [ ] Throughtput
- [ ] Turnaround Time
- [ ] Response Time

### For waiting time 

|             | advantage  |  disadvantage  | Efficiency|
| -----:  | :----:  |  :----:  |  :----:  |
| FCFS  |  easily to implement   | lower efficiency |low |
| RR     |   easily to implement |   lower efficiency  |low |
| SJF(non-preemptive)  |  more effective | if first data&apos;s burst is higher the efficient is bad |   high|
| SJF(preemptive)  |   most effective    |  none | highest|
